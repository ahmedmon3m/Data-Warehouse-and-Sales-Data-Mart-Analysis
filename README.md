What is a data mart ?
A Data Mart is focused on a single functional area of an organization and contains a subset of data stored in a Data Warehouse. A Data Mart is a condensed version of Data Warehouse and is designed for use by a specific department, unit or set of users in an organization. E.g., Marketing, Sales, HR or finance. It is often controlled by a single department in an organization.
